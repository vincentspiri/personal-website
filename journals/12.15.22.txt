Hello friend

Another day another dollar, but in a month those dollars will be coming from Walmart instead of Kwiktrip.
I put in my 2 week notice yesterday so my last day of work at Kwiktrip will be on the 29th.
Am I glad I had to do this?
No.
But I don't think it will be that bad.
I'll get to meet some new people at Walmart and I can focus on myself.
I'm pretty excited about my website I'm building.
I'm making pretty good progress everyday.
Maybe I should make a change log to document the work I do.
I just got done implementing a dark-mode button but it needs a bit more work.
I can't get the whole website to stay in dark-mode after pressing the button.
But I'm sure there's an easy fix for that.
I'm pretty happy about the color scheme for the dark-mode so maybe I'll make that my default and remove the button alltogether.
I'm not sure.
My next steps are probably to make the website look more like a professional website.
And password protect my journal entries so I can port forward it.
Then probably add some other element to the website like a music category or something.
Links to github and instagram would be cool.
I'll eventually have to look into Node.js and React but I don't want to take on too much at once.
But yeah, pretty good day.
We'll see how the weekend goes since I'm closing with Lydia both days.
I'll do the floors on Saturday and she can do them on Sunday.
I think that's fair enough to not get yelled at.
What does it really matter though?
Lydia is Lora's pet anyways.

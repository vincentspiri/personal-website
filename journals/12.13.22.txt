Hello friend

It's very easy to remember the best days and the worst days, but mediocre days like these will be forgotten.
I got to work with Tena today.
Although we were both sick, we powered through...most of the way.
I got to talk to her about what had happened with the promotion. etc.
I felt kind of bad for only complaining about my problems.
It seemed like she had problems of her own but I didn't want to pry to get it out of her.
If she wanted to talk about it she probably would've talked about it.
At least that's what I hope is the case.
Jackie was there too.
She has recently become one of my favorite to work with, and I can't really explain why.
I kind of just trust her.
I'm also wondering if Hannah was playing me this whole time. 
We had been talking for about 2 months or so now but all of the sudden she ghosted me.
I haven't heard from her in the last 4 days.
I feel like 2 months of texting is putting in too much work just to play someone for no reason.
That's the only reason I think there's a chance that her phone broke or she's just insanely busy.
I really don't see why she would be plotting to make my life shittier.
Although it is a pretty big coincidence that she would stop texting me the exact day Lydia stabs me in the back.
I suppose only time will tell.

            <p>
                This is a project website that was created with the purpose of learning and practicing HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript,
                and any other programming languages that might be needed in order to code an amazing website.
                The goal for this website is of course for it to be a functioning website where I can showcase projects
                that I'm working on etc.
                but I also want the website to look nice. Many people, including me, like things that are visually
                appealng and a lot of the times
                driven to like something despite it's many flaws just because it looks nice. Like a BMW.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One thing I do hope to avoid with this website is for it to become bloated.
                I don't want the code to be a massive mess and I don't want the website to load
                slowly or for it to look like a mess either. The plan is to keep it minimal and
                elegant but also avoid making it look generic. Hopefully I can find the artistic
                sweet spot.
